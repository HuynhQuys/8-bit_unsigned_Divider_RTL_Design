# 8-bit_unsigned_Divider_RTL_Design

**Tools:** Vivado

**Hardware Description Language (HDL):** Verilog

**Description:**
- Designed 8-bit divider architecture for unsigned integers based on the Restoring Division Algorithm
- Implemented Processing Unit-based design using Full Adders (FA) and Full Subtractors (FS)
- Verified functionality through simulation in Vivado and analyzed performance in terms of LUT usage and delay
